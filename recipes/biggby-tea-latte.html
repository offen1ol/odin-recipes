                Top Secret Insider Knowledge (super simple easy) recipe for a tea latte lol
            </p>
            <p>
                It's probably common knowledge on how to make a tea latte but just for future reference, Ta-Da!
            </p>
            <p>
                Can use this to apply to any tea latte. I make mine super simple honestly...

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>tea of choice</li>
                <p>1 bag for 16/20oz or 2 bags for 24oz</p>
                <p>They use Fraser Tea (as of 2023) in the past they used Harney & Sons brand</p>
                <li>milk of choice</li>
                <p>I prefer Chobani Extra Creamy Oat Milk. It doesn't have that strong oat or vanilla flavor to it.*</p>
                <p>They use the Califia Oat Milk. I think it's too vanilla-y but my co-workers really like this brand.</p>
                <p>*I am a changed person. I, now, enjoy the Califia brand. Even the store-bought creamy oat milk is just as good as the barista blend. They have the perfect creamy texture.</p>
                <li><b>optional:</b> vanilla syrup</li>
                <p>They use the Monin brand of Vanilla</p>
                <p><b>Crucial</b> when using 2% regular milk or the tea of choice might curdle the milk</p>
                <p>I don't personally use this, it overpowers the tea imo</p>
                <p>3 pumps for 16oz, 4 pumps for 20oz, 5 pumps for 24oz</p>
                <li><b>optional:</b> ice</li>
                <li><b>optional:</b> sweet foam</li>
                <p>They use Rich's On Top Brand of Sweet Foam</p>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <h3>Iced Latte</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>in a cup, steep tea in hot water to your preferred strength. I steep for a long time.</li>
                <p>3oz for 16oz, 4oz for 20oz, 5oz 24oz</p>
                <li>fill separate cup with ice</li>
                <li>cover ice in milk</li>
                <li><b>optional:</b> add in vanilla syrup</li>
                <li>add in steeped tea to milk and stir well</li>
                <li><b>optional:</b> Bonus! add sweet foam to it!</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Hot Latte</h3>
            <p>requires a milk steamer which I don't have... which is why I make it iced at home ðŸ˜…</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Place tea bags into cup</li>
                <li><b>optional:</b> Add vanilla syrup</li>
                <li>Steam milk until 140 deg F</li>
                <p>120 for Not Hot, 160 for Extra Hot</p>
                <li>Stir and let steep before drinking</li>
                <li><b>optional:</b> Sweet Foam is also great in hot drinks! Make sure to foam milk well or it'll sink</li>
            </ol>
