                        <p>
                            This is such a simple recipe but it's a big hit with my family. They ask me to make this often for them.
                             We usually have it with mashed potatoes and a veggie for sides. 
                             It's also nice if you are on a budget since you don't need that many ingredients to make this. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I encourage you to experiment and explore different flavors with this recipe! It's really basic so it'd be really easy to customize if you want to add different seasonings or a sauce to go 
                            along with it. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you end up liking it, I recommend getting one of those deep fryer appliances to save yourself some time. I don't really like messing around with hot oil, so the quicker, the better imo.

                    <h2>Steps</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <b>optional:</b> if thick pieces of chicken, I recommend to butterfly the chicken by just cutting it in half so that you can open it like a book. 
                        </li>
                        <li>crack both eggs in a separate bowl and whisk the eggs until an even color and then set aside</li>
                        <li>season the chicken with salt and pepper to your preference on both sides</li>
                        <li>with a meat tenderizer, tenderize each side of the chicken. if you butterfly'd your piece, make sure you left it open so that the piece will be thinner</li>
                        <li>cover chicken in a thin layer of flour</li>
                        <li>dip chicken in egg mix until evenly coated</li>
                        <li>cover chicken in panko breadcrumbs, make sure breadcrumbs are evenly spread with no gaps for better frying</li>
                        <li>
                            deep fry until panko is golden. keep in mind that larger pieces will take longer to cook than smaller pieces. 
                            <p>oil temperature depends on your deep fryer. Mine allows for 3-4 minutes</p>
                            <p>internal temperature of chicken should be <strong>  165 deg F or 73.9 deg C</strong></p>
                        </li>
                        <li>serve with your preferred sides. I also recommend this chicken with sriracha sauce for some spice!</li>
