            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                This is so quick and easy to make if you want a light dessert. Although my family would eat it all in one sitting...
            </p>
            <p>
                My mom was obsessed with this when I used to live with her. She would ask me to make this for her constantly and would buy the supplies preemptively... so I know it's good!
            </p>
            <p>
                It's basically like a simplistic apple pie if you aren't into the heavy crust or the thick apple pie filling of a normal pie.

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <p>Feel free to skip <strong>optional</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 apples (I used green apples so they would be as mushy after baking)</li>
                <li>1 premade pie dough sheet (I used <em>Pillsbury</em>)</li>
                <li>1/4tsp cinnamon</li>
                <li>1/4tsp nutmeg</li>
                <li>1/4tsp ginger</li>
                <li>1/4tsp allspice</li>
                <li>1/2cup sugar</li>
                <li>1tbsp flour</li>
                <li>egg wash (1 egg needed)</li>
                <li>butter (to your judgement)</li>
                <li>2 1/2tbsp lemon juice</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <p>Feel free to skip optional</p>
            <ol>
                <li>preheat oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
                <li>slice apples, thinner makes it easier to fold pastry later</li>
                <li><strong>optional</strong>: put the sliced apples a bowl of water and mix in the lemon juice, this prevents apples from turning brown before baking</li>
                <li><strong>optional</strong>: microwave apples in the lemon water for 5 minutes to soften the slices. mix halfway through to evenly soften</li>
                <li>unroll the sheet of pie dough on a cookie sheet pan to soften at room temperature</li>
                <li><strong>optional</strong>: drain the apple slices from the water if you followed earlier optional steps</li>
                <li>in a separate large bowl combine all spices and sugar together</li>
                <li>add in the apple slices into the bowl of spices and sugar and mix well until all apples are well coates</li>
                <li>spread the apple slices in your preferred pattern in a circle making sure to keep an inch margin of pie dough uncovered</li>
                <li>fold the pie dough around the apple mixture, I usually pleat the dough when folding to make it neat</li>
                <li>get the egg wash (1 egg and some water and mix well together) and brush it on the folded pie crust until well covered, makes the dough golden</li>
                <li>get a little bit of butter and put it on the top of the exposed apple mixture. can have multiple little pads of butter to evenly melt</li>
                <li>add a pinch of sugar around the pie crust</li>
                <li>bake for about 25 minutes</li>
                <li>let cool for 10 minutes</li>
                <li>Enjoy! Can add vanilla ice cream too!</li>
