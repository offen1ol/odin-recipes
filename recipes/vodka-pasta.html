            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                Based off of YouTuber's <a href="https://youtu.be/8wO4tjO9sUY?si=RCrpM4EN-Idys2Pg">Evan and Katelyn's Vodka Sauce Recipe</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                Super simple and easy to make when you are craving pasta. I pair it with steamed broccoli and add mushrooms to the sauce.

                They have a recipe for their <a href="https://youtu.be/tCt-7p7kZD8?si=tdSLREVD0Nw_3FVX">Magic Broccoli</a> which is good too but sometimes I'm too lazy to make it after making this dish.

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <span>~4 serving size</span>
            <ul>
                <h3>Main</h3>
                <li>1 box of pasta (I get angel hair)</li>
                <p>The original recipe they use penne</p>
                <li>Steamed broccoli</li>
                <p>Feel free to add whatever protein or veggies you like. I think spinach would also pair nicely in the sauce.</p>
                
                <h3>Sauce</h3>
                <li>2tbsp olive oil</li>

                <li>3/4-1cup white wine, red wine, or vodka (no sweet wine)</li>
                <p>I use the Barefoot Pinot Grigio</p>

                <li>2/3 heavy cream</li>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Chop up onions and mushrooms. I'm too lazy to dice so I just roughly chop them up</li>
                <li>Heat butter and oil in a medium or large pot on medium-high heat</li>
                <li>Add in the onions and mushrooms until onions are translucent</li>
                <li>Add in the garlic and cook until veggies are soft</li>
                <li>Pour in the chosen alcohol and cook until the liquid is reduced by half</li>
                <li>You can start boiling water to cook the pasta in a separate pot now and follow the box instructions on how long to cook the noodles</li>
                <li>Add tomato puree and stir constantly for a few minutes</li>
                <li>Reduce heat to low and add the heavy cream, red pepper flakes, salt, pepper, and parmesan</li>
                <li>Cook until the parmesan is melted and evenly incorporated</li>
                <li>Add a little olive oil to the strained pasta to avoid sticking</li>
                <li>steam the broccoli, and just add on top of the pasta and sauce with more parmesan and red pepper flakes</li>
            </ol>
