                        <p>
                            This is Katelyn's award-winning banana muffins recipe from <a href="https://youtu.be/h6jGr7U_xbM?si=usP1XL_6fFSq2tTM" target="_blank">Evan and Katelyn on YouTube</a>. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            These are super easy to and quick to make and you don't need that many ingredients to make them from scratch.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can customize them too. I prefer a little crunch so I added walnuts to mine. But chocolate chips would work well too!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For toppings, they normally melt butter and sprinkle cinnamon sugar on top. But I came up with an alternative...
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you have ever been to Texas Roadhouse, you know about their whipped cinnamon honey butter. I found some at my local Sam's Club that you can buy. Another idea is to add some Nutella on top too. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This makes about 10 regular sized muffins.
                        </p>

                    <h2>Steps</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>preheat oven to 325deg F</li>
                        <li>
                            mix all dry ingredients in a large bowl: flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, nutmeg, and any add-ins of your choosing. this helps with them not sinking during baking.
                        </li>
                        <li>mash up bananas and set off to the side</li>
                        <li>cream butter and brown sugar together in a medium bowl</li>
                        <li> combine the mashed up bananas, egg, and vanilla with the butter and sugar until evenly mixed</li>
                        <li></li>
                        <li>add in the wet mix to the dry mix until just combined. add in the wet mix in little batches to avoid over mixing the batter. </li>
                        <li>prep your baking tin with liners and scoop the mix into them</li>
                        <li>bake for 17-22 minutes or until clean toothpick. There will still be a little wet but can also try to tap the top to see how firm it is.</li>
                        <li>let cool for a couple minutes</li>
                    </ol>
