        <h1>Honey Sriracha Salmon Rice Bowl</h1>
        <img src="../images/salmon.jpg" alt="Salmon, broccoli, and white rice on a plate">
        <p>
            A quick meal to make that is a healthy and balanced dish. The simple dish of just salmon fillet, broccoli florets, and jasmine rice is immediately elevated by the accompanied sauce. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The honey sriracha sauce is also minimal in the ingredients required and is easily versatile to match one's partiality to strong or subdued spice. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Can easily be a cheap meal using frozen salmon and broccoli (which is what I usually do...) so you can have it whenever you want without worrying about expiratory dates.
