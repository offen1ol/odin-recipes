                        <p>
                            My new obsession from working at Biggby. They changed matcha brands to an unsweetened organic one from <a href="https://frasertea.com/products/matcha-organic-green-tea" target="_blank">Fraser</a>. You don't have to dilute the powder in water anymore, or at least we are told we don't have to. The texture is similar to traditional matcha powder where it is finely milled. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This new matcha makes it more difficult to incorporate into the drink quickly. So if you are impatient like me and you don't have a matcha whisk to help you, I use a cheap battery powered milk frother. Bonus if you like foamy drinks. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            It's based off of their Golden Honey Latte recipe but just with matcha instead of espresso.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A lot of my coworkers and I like it. I've been drinking it nonstop. So this is mostly for me to remember how to make in the future. I prefer my matcha iced but I'm sure it's just as good with steamed milk.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <a href="https://frasertea.com/products/matcha-organic-green-tea" target="_blank">Fraser</a> organic matcha powder (or preferred choice)
                        </li>
                        <p> We use this <a href="https://frasertea.com/products/matcha-spoon" target="_blank">specific spoon</a> to measure the matcha. It's comparable to a teaspoon.</p>
                        <p>Using <strong>level</strong> scoops of matcha:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>16oz: 1 scoop</li>
                            <li>20oz: 2 scoops</li>
                            <li>24oz: 3 scoops</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>milk of choice</li>
                        <p>In my <a href="../recipes/biggby-tea-latte.html" target="">Tea Latte Recipe</a> I mentioned that I didn't like the Califia Oat Milk Barista Blend but since working there for awhile... It's starting to grow on me! It works really well with this recipe.</p>

                    <h2>Steps</h2>
                    <h3>Iced Latte</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>put ice in cup</li>
                        <li>add in the two syrups</li>
                        <li>add in the matcha</li>
                        <li>pour in milk to just submerge ice</li>
                        <li>use milk frother to mix, chop with a spoon</li>
                        <p>tip: At Biggby we use bar spoons to chop the ingredients up. Use the back of the spoon to smear matcha clumps side to side against the side of the cup to incorporate it in better.</p>
                        <li>top off with more milk</li>
                        <li><b>optional:</b> can add sweet foam on top</li>
                    </ol>
        
                    <h3>Hot Latte</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>add syrups and matcha into cup</li>
                        <p>tip: kind of swirl the syrup and matcha together in the cup so all of the powder isn't dry to prevent clumps</p>
                        <li>steam milk of choice</li>
                        <p>we regularly heat to 140 deg F </p>
                        <p>100 for kid's, 120 for Not Hot, 160 for Extra Hot</p>
                        <li>pour into cup and stir well</li>
                        <li><b>optional:</b> Sweet foam is great in hot drinks too! make sure to foam milk well and allow the drink to sit for a second after pouring in the milk otherwise it'll sink instead of float</li>
                    </ol>
