Odin HTML Foundations 
Project: Recipes

HTML based project to create a basic recipes repo. I had to use links, images, headings, boilerplate, and lists to create. I also had to get familiar with using git commands and committing my changes. Used recipes I commonly make myself or that I know are enjoyed by my family.
